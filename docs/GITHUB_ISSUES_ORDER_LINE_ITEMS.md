# GitHub Issues: Order Line Items Implementation

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Issue #1: Add OrderLine Entity to Ontology
**Labels**: `backend`, `ontology`, `phase-1`
**Assignee**: Backend Developer
**Story Points**: 3

**Description**:
Add the OrderLine entity class to the ontology schema with all required properties.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] OrderLine class added to ontology with prefix `orderline`
- [ ] Properties defined: `line_of_order`, `line_product`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `line_amount`, `line_sequence`, `perishable_flag`
- [ ] Property types validated: entity_ref, entity_ref, int, float, float, int, bool
- [ ] Migration script created for ontology update

**Technical Notes**:
- ID format: `orderline:{order_number}-{sequence}` (e.g., `orderline:FM-1001-001`)
- `unit_price` snapshots product price at order time
- `perishable_flag` denormalized from product for performance
